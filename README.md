# CCVim
Yet another Vim clone for ComputerCraft, which I'm trying to make work as well as possible.

Currently very limited, but here's what works:
- Insert mode
- Opening files
- Scrolling (both directions)
- Appending files

What's currently being worked on:
- Various ":" commands


What's planned:
- Opening multiple files
- Many other things unable to be listed

Fun fact - this README was written in the program!
