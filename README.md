# CCVim
Yet another Vim clone for ComputerCraft, which I'm trying to make work as well as possible.

Currently very limited, but here's what works:
- Insert mode
- Opening files
- Scrolling (both directions)
- Appending files

What's currently being worked on:
- Varios : commands


What's planned:
- Opening multiple files
- Many other things unable to be listed

What's broken:
- If you try to move back to the right to the X set when moving up or down a line, it doesn't work. I can't make it work. It worked earlier, and I can't see any reason it wouldn't work now. This makes no sense
