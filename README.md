# CCVim
Yet another Vim clone for ComputerCraft, which I'm trying to make work as well as possible.

You can use [TAB] to exit editing mode.

Currently very limited, but here's what works:
- Insert mode
- Append mode
- Opening/Saving files
- Scrolling (both directions)
- Appending files
- Copy - paste

What's currently being worked on:
- Various ":" commands


What's planned:
- Opening multiple files
- Many other things unable to be listed

Fun fact - this README was written in the program!

# Installation
Put ```vim.lua``` as well as the ```lib``` folder in a directory at ```/vim/``` in your CC or CC:Tweaked computer.
