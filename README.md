# CCVim
Yet another Vim clone for ComputerCraft, which I'm trying to make work as well as possible.

You can use [TAB] to exit editing mode.

Currently very limited, but here's what works:
- Insert mode
- Append mode
- Opening/Saving files
- Scrolling (both directions)
- Appending files
- Copy / Cut / Paste
- Jumping to lines
- fF/tT jumping, with repeat/repeat reverse (```;```/```,```)
- Tabs (opening multiple files uses tabs)

What's currently being worked on:
- The grand majority of the things at [this list of VIM commands](https://vim.rtorr.com)
- File browser

Fun fact - this README was written in the program!

# Installation
Run ```pastebin run eX0BrfjA``` on your computer.
