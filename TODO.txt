//TODO

LITTLE PROJECTS:
-- Add the rest of the file explorer commands
-- Reduce flickering in file explorer (reduce render line amount to above and below, don't redraw header, etc)

BIG PROJECTS:
-- Check if file opened in tab
-- Move command handling to its own function so it can be called outside of main loop
-- Visual mode
-- Undo tree
    - Better change detection
